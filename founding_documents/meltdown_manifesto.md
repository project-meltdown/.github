# The Meltdown manifesto
This document outlines what Meltdown is meant to be, its scope, core values and principles.

## Scope
Meltdown is meant to be a software design and development organization that not only makes software but also 
records its findings and teaches its ideals to the world.

## Target audience
Meltdown is aimed at a certain kind of developer: 
* those, who value collective authorship over personal credit.
* those, who don't mind their code being copied.
* those, who are okay with sloppy code, just not in the main branch.

## Core values
1. Compromise between functionality and simplicity
1. Formal design, informal development, formal incorporation
1. Clean releases
1. Proper design
1. Copyright free code

## Antithesis
To define what we want, we must define what we don't want:
* Fully formal or informal development
* Oversimplified("suckless") projects
* Weaponization of copyleft licenses to prevent forks(e.g. GNU)
* Testing(or worse: discovering new usecases) in production
* Low effort releases
* Discussions that go nowhere("bikesheding")

If you can observe any of this in Meltdown, it's not going well.

## Principles
Todo: add principles
